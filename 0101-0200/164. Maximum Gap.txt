similar to bucket sort, let the bucket size be (max-min)/(n-1). there are O(n) buckets. only need to store the min&max elements in each bucket, then find the answer by scanning consecutive nonempty buckets. O(n).

remark. we can also find the minimum gap in randomized O(n) time, by reducing to 2D closest point, and use the randomized incremental algorithm. see 1200. Minimum Absolute Difference.
