naive:\\
$O(n^2)$ by hashing.\\
$O(n^2)$ deterministic: after sorting, enumerate the first number, find the pair of second and third number by monotone pointers.\\


for real numbers:\\
deterministic $O((n^2/\log^2 n)(\log\log n)^{O(1)})$, Chan \cite{chan2018more}.\\

for integers:\\
$O((n^2/\log^2 n)(\log\log n)^2)$ \cite{baran2008subquadratic}, via hashing techniques.\\
