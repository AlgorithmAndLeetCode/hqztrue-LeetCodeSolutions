wlog assume n<=m.
enumerate the top edge and the bottom edge in O(n^2). then we need to solve an 1D problem, by prefix sum and sorting in O(sort(m)). the total running time is O(n^2*sort(m)).

lower bound: the finding maximum sum rectangle problem can be reduced to this problem, so it is hard to solve this in O(n^{3-eps}).
