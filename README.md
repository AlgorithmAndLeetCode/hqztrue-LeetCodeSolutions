LeetCode
========

### Introduction
Here are *theoretical* solutions for some interesting LeetCode problems, aiming for the best running time. The author is a TCS student who no longer remember how to code, so if you are looking for *code implementations*... sorry, this is the wrong place.

## Notations
In some problems we will use the word RAM model, where the assumption is each word has w bits and can store integers up to size W=2^w. In practice (i.e. 32-bit machines), $w=32$ and $W=2^32$.

### Unsolved Problems
Here are a list of problems which I don't know the current best algorithm. If a problem is open but I know the current best algorithm, it is viewed as "solved" and therefore not listed here.

1. Two Sum
